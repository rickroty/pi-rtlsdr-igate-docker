# First you need to specify the name of a Tier 2 server.
# The current preferred way is to use one of these regional rotate addresses:
#     noam.aprs2.net           - for North America
#     soam.aprs2.net          - for South America
#     euro.aprs2.net          - for Europe and Africa
#     asia.aprs2.net           - for Asia

# Some might want to send an IGate client position directly to a server
# without sending it over the air and relying on someone else to
# forward it to an IGate server.  This is done by using sendto=IG rather
# than a radio channel number. Overlay R for receive only, T for two way.
